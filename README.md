Create a new repository in GitHub by clicking the "+" icon in the top right corner of the screen and selecting "New repository". Give your repository a name and a short description, and choose whether to make it public or private.

Once your repository is created, click the "Actions" tab at the top of the screen. This will take you to the GitHub Actions dashboard for your repository.

Click the "New workflow" button, then choose the "Python application" template. This template will create a basic Python workflow that installs dependencies, runs tests, and publishes code coverage reports.

In the editor that appears, you can define the steps that your workflow will perform. Replace the existing code with the following:

'''
yaml
Copy code
name: Python workflow\

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest
      - name: Print message
        run: |
          echo "All good"
'''
This workflow will trigger on push events, and it will run on an Ubuntu virtual machine. The steps install the necessary dependencies, run a test using pytest, and print the message "All good".

Once you've defined your workflow, click the "Start commit" button to commit the YAML file to your repository. You can add a commit message to describe the changes you made.

GitHub will automatically start running your workflow on the next push event. You can view the progress of your workflow on the "Actions" tab of your repository.

That's it! You've now created a test repository for Python in GitHub using GitHub Actions and printed "All good". You can customize your workflows further by adding additional steps and configuring how they run.
